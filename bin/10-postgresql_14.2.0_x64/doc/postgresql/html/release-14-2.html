   This release contains a variety of fixes from 14.1.
   For information about new features in major release 14, see
   <a class="xref" href="release-14.html" title="E.3. Release 14">Section E.3</a>.

    A dump/restore is not required for those running 14.X.
   </p><p>
    However, some bugs have been found that may have resulted in
    corrupted indexes, as explained in the first two changelog entries.
    If any of those cases apply to you, it's recommended to reindex
    possibly-affected indexes after updating.
   </p><p>
    Also, if you are upgrading from a version earlier than 14.1,
    see <a class="xref" href="release-14-1.html" title="E.2. Release 14.1">Section E.2</a>.

      Enforce standard locking protocol for TOAST table updates, to prevent
      problems with <code class="command">REINDEX CONCURRENTLY</code> (Michael Paquier)
     </p><p>
      If applied to a TOAST table or TOAST table's index, <code class="command">REINDEX
      CONCURRENTLY</code> tended to produce a corrupted index.  This
      happened because sessions updating TOAST entries released
      their <code class="literal">ROW EXCLUSIVE</code> locks immediately, rather
      than holding them until transaction commit as all other updates do.
      The fix is to make TOAST updates hold the table lock according to the
      normal rule.  Any existing corrupted indexes can be repaired by
      reindexing again.

      Fix corruption of HOT chains when a RECENTLY_DEAD tuple changes
      state to fully DEAD during page pruning (Andres Freund)
     </p><p>
      It was possible for <code class="command">VACUUM</code> to remove a
      recently-dead tuple while leaving behind a redirect item that
      pointed to it.  When the tuple's item slot is later re-used by
      some new tuple, that tuple would be seen as part of the
      pre-existing HOT chain, creating a form of index corruption.
      If this has happened, reindexing the table should repair the
      damage.  However, this is an extremely low-probability scenario,
      so we do not recommend reindexing just on the chance that it might
      have happened.

      Fix incorrect plan creation for parallel single-child Append nodes
      (David Rowley)
     </p><p>
      In some cases the Append would be simplified away when it should not

      Fix index-only scan plans for cases where not all index columns can

     </p><p>
      If an index has both returnable and non-returnable columns, and one
      of the non-returnable columns is an expression using a table column
      that appears in a returnable index column, then a query using that
      expression could result in an index-only scan plan that attempts to
      read the non-returnable column, instead of recomputing the
      expression from the returnable column as intended.  The
      non-returnable column would read as NULL, resulting in wrong query
      results.

      Fix checking of <code class="type">anycompatible</code>-family data type matches
      (Tom Lane)
     </p><p>
      In some cases the parser would think that a function or operator
      with <code class="type">anycompatible</code>-family polymorphic parameters
      matches a set of arguments that it really shouldn't match.  In
      reported cases, that led to matching more than one operator to a
      call, leading to ambiguous-operator errors; but a failure later on
      is also possible.

      Fix startup of a physical replica to tolerate transaction ID
      wraparound (Abhijit Menon-Sen, Tomas Vondra)
     </p><p>
      If a replica server is started while the set of active transactions
      on the primary crosses a wraparound boundary (so that there are some
      newer transactions with smaller XIDs than older ones), the replica
      would fail with <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">out-of-order XID insertion in

      In logical replication, avoid double transmission of a child table's

      If a publication includes both child and parent tables, and has
      the <code class="literal">publish_via_partition_root</code> option set,
      subscribers uselessly initiated synchronization on both child and
      parent tables.  Ensure that only the parent table is synchronized in
      such cases.

      Remove lexical limitations for SQL commands issued on a logical

     </p><p>
      The walsender process would fail for a SQL command containing an
      unquoted semicolon, or with dollar-quoted literals containing odd
      numbers of single or double quote marks, or when the SQL command
      starts with a comment.  Moreover, faulty error recovery could lead
      to unexpected errors in later commands too.

      Build extended statistics for partitioned tables (Justin Pryzby)
     </p><p>
      A previous bug fix disabled building of extended statistics for
      old-style inheritance trees, but it also prevented building them for
      partitioned tables, which was an unnecessary restriction.
      This change allows <code class="command">ANALYZE</code> to compute values for
      statistics objects for partitioned tables.  (But note that
      autovacuum does not process partitioned tables as such, so you must
      periodically issue manual <code class="command">ANALYZE</code> on the
      partitioned table if you want to maintain such statistics.)
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
      Ignore extended statistics for inheritance trees (Justin Pryzby)
     </p><p>
      Currently, extended statistics values are only computed locally for
      each table, not for entire inheritance trees.  However the values
      were mistakenly consulted when planning queries across inheritance
      trees, possibly resulting in worse-than-default estimates.

      Disallow altering data type of a partitioned table's columns when
      the partitioned table's row type is used as a composite type
      elsewhere (Tom Lane)
     </p><p>
      This restriction has long existed for regular tables, but through an
      oversight it was not checked for partitioned tables.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
      Disallow <code class="literal">ALTER TABLE ... DROP NOT NULL</code> for a
      column that is part of a replica identity index (Haiying Tang, Hou

      The same prohibition already existed for primary key indexes.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
      Correctly update cached table state during <code class="command">ALTER TABLE ADD
      PRIMARY KEY USING INDEX</code> (Hou Zhijie)
     </p><p>
      Concurrent sessions failed to update their opinion of whether the
      table has a primary key, possibly causing incorrect logical
      replication behavior.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
      Correctly update cached table state when switching <code class="literal">REPLICA
      IDENTITY</code> index (Tang Haiying, Hou Zhijie)
     </p><p>
      Concurrent sessions failed to update their opinion of which index is
      the replica identity one, possibly causing incorrect logical
      replication behavior.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
      Fix failure of SP-GiST indexes when the indexed column's data type
      is binary-compatible with the declared input type of the operator
      class (Tom Lane)
     </p><p>
      Such cases should work, but failed with <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">compress method must

      Allow parallel vacuuming and concurrent index building to be ignored
      while computing oldest xmin (Masahiko Sawada)
     </p><p>
      Non-parallelized instances of these operations were already ignored,
      but the logic did not work for parallelized cases.  Holding back the
      xmin horizon has undesirable effects such as delaying vacuum
      cleanup.

      Fix memory leak when updating expression indexes (Peter Geoghegan)

      options in <code class="structname">pg_hba_file_rules</code> view (Magnus
      Hagander)
     </p><p>
      The <code class="literal">cert</code> authentication method implies
      <code class="literal">clientcert=verify-full</code>, but the
      <code class="structname">pg_hba_file_rules</code> view incorrectly reported
      <code class="literal">clientcert=verify-ca</code>.

     </p><p>
      Previously, a sufficiently high setting
      of <code class="varname">client_min_messages</code> could result in the log
      message also being sent to the connected client.  Since that client
      hadn't requested it, that would be surprising (and possibly a wire
      protocol violation).
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
      Fix display of whole-row variables appearing
      in <code class="literal">INSERT ... VALUES</code> rules (Tom Lane)
     </p><p>
      A whole-row variable would be printed as <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">var.*</span>”</span>,
      but that allows it to be expanded to individual columns when
      the rule is reloaded, resulting in different semantics.
      Attach an explicit cast to prevent that, as we do elsewhere.

     </p><p>
      <code class="function">PQcancel</code> is supposed to be safe to call from a
      signal handler, but <code class="function">strerror</code> is not safe.  The
      faulty usage only occurred in the unlikely event of failure to

      This agrees with the documented behavior, and avoids probable

      Index-only scans returned column values with trailing spaces

      The behavior of such an index will not change immediately unless
