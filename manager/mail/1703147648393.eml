Hi User 4 UNS,

A new account has been created for you at 'Moodle 412'
and you have been issued with a new temporary password.

Your current login information is now:
username: user4@uns.ac.id
password: ?b9ByaD/$z
(you will have to change your password
when you login for the first time)

To start using 'Moodle 412', login at
https://moodle412.local/login/?lang=3Den

In most mail programs, this should appear as a blue link
which you can just click on. If that doesn't work,
then cut and paste the address into the address
line at the top of your web browser window.

Cheers from the 'Moodle 412' administrator,

Admin User
